I've always been a f√£ of FiveThirtyEight's work, and I would follow weekly their NFL predictions. So, with a lot of free time and the lack of something similar for the Brazilian soccer tournaments, I decided to do something similar.

I'll be writing a series of articles detailing the all the steps to build a soccer prediction system, the math behind it, the data, and of course, the results.


## Overview

I'm building it around the Elo rating system, analysing the data from the 1900s until this year. It's a relatively simple system, implemented in Java, and it's all Open Source for whoever wants to use it, or improve it.

At the end of it, I'm also planning on leaving it all live on a webpage regularly updated until the end of the 2017 national championship so that people (or mostly just me) can follow week by week each team's likelihood of winning it, qualifying to the Libertadores, or being relegated to the B series.

The intention behind this is to document my thought process, the system, and mostly a journal of the software development.


## Articles

I'll keep a list of the articles in this section as I'm writing them, just to keep them all in the same place.
